# GAMEBOY_ADVANCE_Dev
Making real .GB roms to flash onto everdrive cartridges. Fun lil side projects!!!


Description: Hi! For this project, I was interested in what it would take to develop a viable Gameboy Advance Game, from concepts to a playable cartridge.
So, I started following Loirak's tutorials in an effort to get familiar setting up the gbasdk environment, writing some source code in C, and compiling 
some working ROMS! Eventually, I wish to be able to develop my own ROM files and GAMES, and this repo is where I will keep all my progress.
So, here we go:

-The folder "gbasrc" contains ALL the source code for the different ROMs I'm making. Within, each Rom is separated into its own subfolder.... or at least
it is on my PC; github deletes subfolders.

NOT UPLOADED RN! -->-
The folder "devkitadv" contains all the install data of the development environment, which was developed by Jason Wilkins (HUGE thanks to him!!!)***

-The folder "assets" contains the image sprites and .aseprite files used to make assets for the games. They're all designed in Aseprite, then converted
to C arrays using EITHER pcx2gba.exe (dev by Digital Inline) OR the more modern png2gba.exe (dev. by Ian Finlayson here on GitHub). Yeah. Okay.
