----------- GBACaster -----------------------------------------

A small GBA raycasting demo, This same concept is what was used
to make the original wolfenstein 3d. But unfortunately, I'm not
John Carmack, and this won't run super fast. It is simple code
very easy to understand. The map is based on a 16x16 grid of 
64x64 tiles. You can easily change and manipulate the map. This
demo also has collision detection. It was compiled with the
DevKitAdv. 

Instructions. Use the key pad to move around very slowly. 

It is based off a tutorial by F. Permadi. You can get the tutor 
here : http://www.permadi.com/tutorial/raycast/index.html

This was made by Loirak Development (a hobby group), you can

I have included the dsp files for Visual C++ if you want
to use that as your development environment. When compiled 
the project runs the MAKE.BAT that is included.

If you dont have or want to use VisualC++ as your IDE, then
you can simply use MAKE.BAT, which is included. You can double 
click in from a windows browser, or run it from a dos command 
prompt. 

For more information look at the top of gbacaster.c there is a 
ton of comments about the implementation.
